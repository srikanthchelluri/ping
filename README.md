# Ping

This repository is a playground for an idea I had: combining a to-do list and a calendar. Use case: you're in a work-environment (the office, research lab, whatever it may be) and you'd like to talk to your mentor or someone else specific. Often times, context-switching is hindersome so this simply let's you "ping" your mentor, allowing the mentor to see it on his/her end and getting to it whenever he/she can. It's a simple, running to-do list that is modifiable by anyone.

More details possibly later down the road - if I continue this project.
